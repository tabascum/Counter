# count
This is a counter I set to practice JavaScript's functions, more specifically conditional statements and loops.
Since most people knows Sesame Street's The Count Count, decided to include him in this little exercice.
I do not own any rights on the image of The Count Count. Rights belong to their rightful owners.
